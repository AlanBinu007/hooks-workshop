# Welcome to the testing project!

## Get Started

1. `npm install` to install dependencies (for running the app and testing it)
2. `npm start` to see the app (so far... in its broken state)
3. `npm test` to run tests!

## Unit + Integration Testing

Any file in `/modules/app` that ends with `.test.js` will be run and tested by Jest when you run `npm test`.

## E2E Testing

Any file in `/modules/app` that ends with `.e2e.js` will be run and tested by Jest + Puppeteer when you run `npm run e2e`. (Don't do this yet!)
